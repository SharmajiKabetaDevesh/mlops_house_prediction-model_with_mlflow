This repository showcases a machine learning model for house price prediction developed using MLflow. The project includes:

Model Training: The model is trained using a Random Forest algorithm, leveraging the power of MLflow for experiment tracking, logging metrics, and managing the model lifecycle.
Model Deployment: The trained model is registered in the MLflow Model Registry, making it easily deployable to various serving environments.
Model Validation: A validation step is implemented to ensure the model's performance on new data before deployment.
Key Features:

MLflow Integration: Seamlessly integrates with MLflow for experiment management, model tracking, and deployment.
Model Registry: Model is registered in the MLflow Model Registry for efficient versioning and deployment.
Model Validation: Includes a validation step to ensure model reliability and performance.
Clear Documentation: The project includes clear documentation and code comments for easy understanding and reproducibility.
This project provides a practical example of how to use MLflow for building, managing, and deploying machine learning models, making it a valuable resource for learning and experimentation in MLOps.
